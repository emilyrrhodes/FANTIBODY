1. Download all of the fasta files for the structure I want to model.

2. Delete the heading, except for the name of the structure.

3. Go to https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins to search for similar structures.
a. Copy and paste your fasta sequence into the text box. 
b. Select pdb databank for the databank option. 
c. Click show results in a new window. 
d. Click blast.

4. Identify structures with similar sequences. 

5. Download aligned sequences. 
a. Go the graphical summary tab. 
b. Click on the squence you want. 
c. Click download. 
d. In the drop down menu select 

6. Download the pdb structures. 

7. Remove all the chains that are not needed for alignment from the pdb files. 

8. Paste all the files in one file. 

9. Do sequence alignment. 
a. Go to: https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/ClustalW.html
b. Use PIR output format option. 
c. Only compare sequence with target: select one target and one template. 
d. Download the PIR output file. 
e. Repeat with the other sequences. 

10. Combined the aligned sequence files by pasting the alignment with the other target and alignment. 

11. Rename the sequence as: 
sequence:[name of sequence]:[first amino acid number]:[chain name]:[last amino acid number]:[organism name]:[protein name]:[source of protein]:[resolution factor]:[r factor]
	Ex:sequence:target:1::439:human:Pertuzumab:::

12. Rename the aligned sequences: 
structure[how structure was solved]:[name of file]:[first amino acid number]:[chain name]:[last amino acid number]:[organism name]:[protein name]:[source of protein]:[resolution factor]:[r factor]
	Ex:structureX:1s78.pdb:1:D:216:human:Pertuzumab:10.1016/S1535-6108(04)00083-2:3.25 ANGSTROMS:0.227 

13. Make sure that the missing residues in the pdb structure are represented in the alignment file. 
a. Open the pdb file. 
b. Search for missing residues. 
c. Search for the missing residues in the alignment file. 
d. Delete missing residues and replace them with dashes in the alignment file. 

14. Copy loop.py and model-multiple.py to your working directory. 
a. Go to /Library/modeller-10.1/examples/automodel
b. Copy loop.py and model-multiple.py to your working directory. 


15. Edit model-multiple.py. 
a. Change the alnfile variable to be the name of your alignment file. 
b. Change the name of knowns to the name of your known structures you want 
c. Change the name of the sequence to the target sequence you want to project. 

16. Run modeller. 
Command: mod10.1 model-multiple.py

17. Look at the log output file. 

18. Copy the end of the file with the scores and find the one with the smallest score. 

19. Take the pdb file with the smallest score and view it in pymol or vmd. 

20. Identify unfolded regions of the protein. 

21. Edit loop.py
a. Change the inimodel variable to be the output from the modeller run. 
b. Change the numbers of residues to properly fold. 
c. Change the number of loops. 

22. Run the loop folding. 
Command: mod10.1 loop.py

23. Check the structure on https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/Verify3D/. 
a. Go to: https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/Verify3D/
b. Upload the pdb file. 
c. Run procheck.

24. Make sure the structure looks good by looking at the Ramachandran Plot.
